## SBG User Conference 2018: ~~Extended~~ slippery slopes

### Date
11.2018

### Description

This talk is about the extended slope feature developed in Leica iCON office (SBG Geo Professional): generating a slope that connects the design TIN surface to the terrain TIN surface with a fixed slope angle. The presentation follows the algorithm design process, demonstrates challenges and hidden complexities, and discusses the advantages and limitations of the implementation.

## StockholmCpp 0x31: Stories of CDT

### Date
3.10.2024

### Description

CDT is a C++ library for constrained Delaunay triangulation. It started about 5 years ago and will soon reach 1K stars on GitHub. The talk will share stories about developing and maintaining CDT and lessons learned along the way.
